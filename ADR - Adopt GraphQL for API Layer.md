## Context

### Background

Our current API landscape consists of 15+ independent REST APIs developed by different teams over 5 years. This fragmentation creates significant challenges for consumer applications.

**Business Problem:**
- **Over-fetching**: Mobile apps download 3-5x more data than needed, impacting performance and data costs
- **Under-fetching**: Web app makes 8-12 round trips to render a single page
- **Inconsistency**: Each API has different authentication, error handling, and versioning approaches
- **Poor DX**: Developers spend excessive time integrating multiple APIs
- **Documentation Drift**: API documentation frequently out of sync with implementation

**Current Constraints:**
- Cannot break existing API consumers during migration
- Limited backend engineering capacity for large-scale refactoring
- Need to maintain backward compatibility
- Security and authorization must remain robust

**Technical Context:**
- 15 REST APIs serving web, mobile, and partner integrations
- 4 development teams maintaining different API surfaces
- Frontend teams frustrated with API complexity
- Average API response contains 60% unused data

### Problem Statement

We need an API layer that:
- Provides flexible data fetching (clients request exactly what they need)
- Offers strong typing and schema validation
- Enables better developer experience with introspection and tooling
- Consolidates authentication and authorization
- Reduces network overhead and improves performance
- Maintains backward compatibility during transition

**Key Challenges:**
- Team learning curve for GraphQL
- N+1 query problem and performance optimization
- Caching strategy for GraphQL queries
- Authorization at field level
- Migration path from existing REST APIs

**Requirements:**
- Must support real-time subscriptions for future use cases
- Strong typing for better IDE support and fewer runtime errors
- Compatible with existing authentication (OAuth 2.0 + JWT)
- Must integrate with current monitoring and observability tools
- Phased migration approach to minimize risk

---

## Decision

**We will adopt GraphQL with Apollo Server as our standard API technology, initially wrapping existing REST APIs before gradually migrating to native GraphQL resolvers.**

**Rationale:**
1. **Efficient Data Fetching**: Clients request exactly the data they need, eliminating over/under-fetching
2. **Strong Typing**: GraphQL schema provides type safety and better tooling support
3. **Single Endpoint**: Consolidates 15 REST endpoints into unified GraphQL API
4. **Developer Experience**: Introspection, GraphQL Playground, and IDE integration dramatically improve DX
5. **Versionless**: Schema evolution without versioning reduces maintenance burden
6. **Ecosystem**: Mature tooling (Apollo Client/Server, Relay, GraphQL Code Generator)

**Implementation Approach:**

**Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)**
- Set up Apollo Server with basic configuration
- Implement authentication/authorization middleware
- Create GraphQL schema for 2 pilot endpoints
- Wrap existing REST APIs using data sources
- Deploy to staging environment

**Phase 2: Pilot (Months 3-4)**
- Migrate web app dashboard to use GraphQL (lowest risk)
- Measure performance improvements
- Gather developer feedback
- Refine patterns and best practices
- Document lessons learned

**Phase 3: Expansion (Months 5-8)**
- Gradually migrate remaining REST APIs to GraphQL wrappers
- Start implementing native GraphQL resolvers
- Migrate mobile apps to GraphQL
- Deprecate redundant REST endpoints (with 6-month notice)

**Phase 4: Optimization (Months 9-12)**
- Implement advanced features (subscriptions, federation)
- Optimize N+1 queries with DataLoader
- Implement field-level caching
- Complete migration of native resolvers

## Considered Alternatives

### Alternative 1: Continue with REST + OpenAPI

* **Description**: Improve existing REST APIs with better OpenAPI documentation and consolidation
* **Pros**:
  - No learning curve - team already knows REST
  - Mature patterns and tooling
  - Standard HTTP caching works well
  - Widely understood by all developers
* **Cons**:
  - Doesn't solve over/under-fetching problems
  - Still requires multiple round trips for complex UIs
  - Versioning burden continues
  - Limited flexibility for clients
* **Fit with requirements**: Addresses some issues but doesn't fundamentally improve data fetching

**Rejected Because:** REST's rigid structure cannot address core problems of over-fetching and multiple round trips. Incremental improvements insufficient for long-term goals.

### Alternative 2: gRPC

* **Description**: High-performance RPC framework using Protocol Buffers
* **Pros**:
  - Excellent performance with binary protocol
  - Strong typing with protobuf
  - Efficient network usage
  - Good for microservice communication
* **Cons**:
  - Poor browser support (requires grpc-web proxy)
  - Limited tooling for frontend developers
  - Not designed for flexible client queries
  - Steeper learning curve than GraphQL
* **Fit with requirements**: Great for backend services but poor fit for client-facing APIs

**Rejected Because:** gRPC excels at backend-to-backend communication but lacks the flexible querying capabilities needed for diverse client applications (web, mobile, partners).

### Alternative 3: OData

* **Description**: OASIS standard for RESTful APIs with query capabilities
* **Pros**:
  - RESTful with flexible querying
  - Industry standard (Microsoft ecosystem)
  - Mature specification
* **Cons**:
  - Limited adoption outside Microsoft stack
  - Complex query syntax
  - Smaller ecosystem than GraphQL
  - Less intuitive for frontend developers
* **Fit with requirements**: Provides query flexibility but lacks ecosystem and developer experience

**Rejected Because:** OData has limited industry momentum and inferior developer experience compared to GraphQL. Learning investment better spent on more widely adopted technology.

## Consequences

### Positive Impacts

* Reduced network traffic (estimated 50-70% reduction based on PoC)
* Faster frontend development (single API call vs multiple)
* Better type safety reduces runtime errors
* Improved mobile app performance (less data usage)
* Single authentication/authorization layer
* Self-documenting API via introspection

**Benefits:**
- Web app page load time reduced from 2.3s to 0.8s (PoC data)
- Mobile data usage reduced by 60% (PoC measurement)
- Frontend development velocity increase (estimated 30%)
- Unified API gateway simplifies security
- Better developer onboarding with GraphQL Playground

### Negative Impacts

* Learning curve for development teams (2-3 months)
* N+1 query problem requires careful optimization
* Caching more complex than REST
* Need new performance monitoring approach
* Initial slower development during learning phase
* Additional infrastructure for Apollo Server

**Drawbacks:**
- 3-month initial productivity dip during learning
