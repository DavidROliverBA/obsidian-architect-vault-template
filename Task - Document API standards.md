# Document API standards

## Description

Create comprehensive API standards documentation covering REST, GraphQL (if approved), authentication, versioning, error handling, and best practices. This will serve as the authoritative guide for all teams developing APIs.

**Background:**
- Currently have fragmented, undocumented API practices across teams
- Each team implements authentication, error handling differently
- New developers struggle to understand API conventions
- Need standards before expanding API landscape

**Scope:**
1. REST API standards (existing APIs)
2. GraphQL standards (pending [[ADR - Adopt GraphQL for API Layer]] approval)
3. Authentication/authorization patterns (OAuth 2.0 + JWT)
4. Error handling and HTTP status codes (RFC 7807)
5. Versioning strategy
6. Rate limiting guidelines
7. API documentation requirements (OpenAPI/GraphQL schema)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Draft REST API standards (based on existing best practices)
- [ ] Draft GraphQL standards (if ADR approved by Jan 15)
- [ ] Include code examples for each pattern (Python, TypeScript)
- [ ] Document error handling with example responses
- [ ] Define versioning strategy (URL-based vs header-based)
- [ ] Specify OpenAPI 3.0 documentation requirements
- [ ] Review with [[Jane Smith]] and development team leads
- [ ] Publish to internal documentation wiki (Confluence)
- [ ] Present at engineering all-hands meeting
- [ ] Create checklist template for API reviews

## Notes

**2026-01-07:** Waiting for GraphQL ADR decision before completing GraphQL section. Can start REST standards documentation now.

**Dependencies:**
- [[Task - Review GraphQL ADR]] - Need outcome before finalizing GraphQL standards
- [[ADR - Adopt GraphQL for API Layer]] - If rejected, focus entirely on REST

**Resources:**
- [[Page - Tech Stack Overview]] - Current tech standards
- [[Page - Architecture Principles]] - "APIs are Contracts" principle
- [[Weblink - AWS Well-Architected Framework]] - API best practices

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days of focused work
