# Architecture Principles

> **Guiding principles for architecture decisions and technical standards**

Last Updated: 2026-01-07

---

## Purpose

This document establishes the core architecture principles that guide all technical decision-making within our organization. These principles serve as a framework for evaluating options, making trade-offs, and ensuring consistency across systems.

---

## Principle 1: Simplicity Over Complexity

**Statement:** Choose the simplest solution that solves the problem.

**Rationale:**
- Simple systems are easier to understand, maintain, and operate
- Complexity should only be introduced when there is clear, measurable value
- "You aren't gonna need it" (YAGNI) - don't build for hypothetical future needs

**Implications:**
- Default to boring, proven technologies over new, exciting ones
- Prefer monoliths over microservices unless scale demands otherwise
- Optimize for readability and maintainability over cleverness
- Question every dependency, abstraction, and layer

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Good**: Using PostgreSQL for CRUD application (proven, simple)
- ❌ **Bad**: Using microservices + event sourcing for 3-user internal tool
- ✅ **Good**: Direct function calls within a module
- ❌ **Bad**: Message queue for in-process communication

**Related ADRs:**
- [[ADR - Standardize on PostgreSQL]] - Simplicity through standardization

---

## Principle 2: Build vs Buy vs Rent

**Statement:** Rent before buying, buy before building.

**Rationale:**
- Building custom solutions is expensive and creates ongoing maintenance burden
- SaaS/managed services reduce operational overhead
- Buying COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) provides immediate functionality
- Building should be reserved for competitive differentiators

**Decision Framework:**
1. **Rent (SaaS/Managed Service)**: First choice for commodity needs
   - Examples: Email (SendGrid), Auth (Auth0), Monitoring (DataDog)
   - Pros: No ops burden, fast time-to-value, predictable costs
   - Cons: Vendor lock-in, ongoing costs, limited customization

2. **Buy (COTS/Open Source)**: When rental options don't exist or have unacceptable trade-offs
   - Examples: Commercial databases, enterprise software
   - Pros: One-time cost, more control, customizable
   - Cons: Integration effort, maintenance, version upgrades

3. **Build (Custom Development)**: Only for core business differentiators
   - Examples: Proprietary algorithms, unique business logic
   - Pros: Perfect fit, competitive advantage, full control
   - Cons: High cost, ongoing maintenance, expertise required

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Rent**: AWS RDS instead of managing PostgreSQL servers
- ✅ **Buy**: Adopting Kong for API gateway instead of building custom
- ✅ **Build**: Custom recommendation engine (core business value)
- ❌ **Build**: Custom authentication system (commodity, high risk)

**Related ADRs:**
- [[ADR - Use Kubernetes for Container Orchestration]] - Rent EKS control plane

## Principle 3: Security by Default

**Statement:** Security is not negotiable - it must be built in from the start.

**Rationale:**
- Security vulnerabilities can destroy business value instantly
- Retrofitting security is expensive and often incomplete
- Regulatory compliance requires demonstrable security practices
- Principle of least privilege reduces blast radius

**Implications:**
- All systems must have authentication and authorization
- Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Security reviews required for all architecture decisions
- Regular security scanning and penetration testing
- Automated security checks in CI/CD pipeline

**Security Checklist:**
- [ ] Authentication implemented (OAuth 2.0 + JWT)
- [ ] Authorization with principle of least privilege
- [ ] Data encryption (at rest: AES-256, in transit: TLS 1.3)
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Dependency scanning for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Secrets managed via vault (never in code)
- [ ] Audit logging enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Security review completed

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Good**: All APIs require OAuth tokens, rate limited, input validated
- ❌ **Bad**: Internal tool with no authentication ("it's only internal")
- ✅ **Good**: Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager, rotated quarterly
- ❌ **Bad**: Database passwords in environment variables

---

## Principle 4: Design for Failure

**Statement:** Assume everything will fail and design accordingly.

**Rationale:**
- In distributed systems, failure is inevitable, not exceptional
- Graceful degradation better than complete outage
- Observability enables fast incident response
- Chaos engineering uncovers failure modes before production

**Implications:**
- Implement timeouts, retries with exponential backoff
- Circuit breakers to prevent cascade failures
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting
- Documented runbooks for common failures
- Regular disaster recovery testing

**Resilience Patterns:**
1. **Timeouts**: Every external call has a deadline
2. **Retries**: Idempotent operations retry with backoff
3. **Circuit Breakers**: Fail fast when downstream is unhealthy
4. **Bulkheads**: Isolate resources to prevent total failure
5. **Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when features unavailable

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Good**: API returns cached data when database unavailable
- ❌ **Bad**: Infinite retry loop brings down calling service
- ✅ **Good**: Multi-AZ database deployment with automated failover
- ❌ **Bad**: Single point of failure with no backup

**Related ADRs:**
- [[ADR - Use Kubernetes for Container Orchestration]] - Self-healing infrastructure

## Principle 5: Data is an Asset

**Statement:** Treat data as a valuable organizational asset requiring stewardship.

**Rationale:**
- Data outlives applications - invest in data quality and governance
- Poor data quality leads to poor business decisions
- Data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) require proper handling
- Data should be accessible for analytics and insights

**Implications:**
- Defined data ownership and stewardship
- Data quality monitoring and validation
- Clear data retention and archival policies
- Data catalog for discoverability
- Privacy by design (minimize collection, anonymize when possible)
- Consistent data formats and naming conventions

**Data Governance:**
1. **Ownership**: Every dataset has a designated owner
2. **Quality**: Automated quality checks in pipelines
3. **Privacy**: PII identified, encrypted, access controlled
4. **Lifecycle**: Clear retention and deletion policies
5. **Documentation**: Data dictionary and lineage tracked

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Good**: Customer PII encrypted, access logged, retention policy enforced
- ❌ **Bad**: Sensitive data copied to development databases
- ✅ **Good**: Data catalog enables self-service analytics
- ❌ **Bad**: Undocumented data dumps shared via email

## Principle 6: Measure Everything

**Statement:** You can't improve what you don't measure.

**Rationale:**
- Objective data beats subjective opinions
- Metrics enable data-driven decisions
- Observability critical for operating production systems
- Early detection of issues through monitoring

**What to Measure:**
1. **Business Metrics**: Conversion rates, user engagement, revenue
2. **Performance**: Latency (p50, p95, p99), throughput, error rates
3. **Reliability**: Uptime, SLO compliance, incident frequency
4. **Cost**: Infrastructure spend, cost per transaction
5. **Engineering**: Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR

**Observability Pillars:**
- **Metrics**: Time-series data (Prometheus, CloudWatch)
- **Logs**: Structured logging (JSON format, correlation IDs)
- **Traces**: Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger)
- **Dashboards**: Real-time visualization (Grafana, DataDog)

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Good**: All services emit RED metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration)
- ❌ **Bad**: No metrics, only logs, debugging is guesswork
- ✅ **Good**: SLO dashboard shows 99.9% availability target compliance
- ❌ **Bad**: "The system feels slow" with no data

## Principle 7: APIs are Contracts

**Statement:** Treat APIs as contracts with consumers - breaking changes harm trust.

**Rationale:**
- API consumers depend on stability
- Breaking changes create cascading failures
- Good API design is a competitive advantage
- Backward compatibility enables independent deployment

**Implications:**
- Version APIs (prefer URL versioning or content negotiation)
- Add fields, never remove (additive changes safe)
- Deprecation process with notice period (minimum 6 months)
- Comprehensive API documentation (OpenAPI/GraphQL schema)
- Contract testing to prevent breaking changes

**API Standards:**
1. **Consistency**: Standard patterns across all APIs
2. **Versioning**: Explicit version in URL or header
3. **Documentation**: Auto-generated, always up-to-date
4. **Error Handling**: Consistent error format (RFC 7807)
5. **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 + JWT standard
6. **Rate Limiting**: Documented limits, graceful degradation

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Good**: `/v1/users` → `/v2/users` with 12-month parallel support
- ❌ **Bad**: Changing field names in existing API version
- ✅ **Good**: GraphQL schema with deprecation annotations
- ❌ **Bad**: Undocumented API changes breaking mobile apps

**Related ADRs:**
- [[ADR - Adopt GraphQL for API Layer]] - Modern API approach

## Principle 8: Automate Repetition

**Statement:** If you do it more than twice, automate it.

**Rationale:**
- Manual processes are error-prone and don't scale
- Automation enables consistency and repeatability
- Infrastructure-as-code provides audit trail
- Automation frees humans for high-value work

**Automation Priorities:**
1. **Build & Deploy**: CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, ArgoCD)
2. **Infrastructure**: Terraform for all resources
3. **Testing**: Unit, integration, E2E tests automated
4. **Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning
5. **Monitoring**: Auto-remediation for common issues
6. **Database**: Schema migrations automated

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Good**: Infrastructure provisioned via Terraform, reviewed in Git
- ❌ **Bad**: Manual server configuration via SSH
- ✅ **Good**: Automated database backups with tested restore process
- ❌ **Bad**: DBA manually backs up databases with untested restore

## Applying These Principles

### Decision Framework

When evaluating architecture options:

1. **Identify Options**: List viable technical approaches
2. **Evaluate Against Principles**: Score each option on principle alignment
3. **Make Trade-offs Explicit**: Document where principles conflict
4. **Document Decision**: Create ADR explaining rationale
5. **Review Periodically**: Principles and decisions evolve

### Principle Conflicts

Sometimes principles conflict - examples:

- **Simplicity vs Resilience**: Adding redundancy increases complexity
  - Resolution: Accept complexity for critical paths, keep non-critical simple

- **Build vs Security**: Custom auth faster than integrating Auth0
  - Resolution: Security principle overrides - use proven auth provider

- **Measure vs Performance**: Detailed logging impacts latency
  - Resolution: Structured logging with sampling for high-traffic paths

### Exceptions

Principles are guidelines, not laws. Exceptions are acceptable when:
- Business context demands it (regulatory, competitive)
- Cost of following principle exceeds benefit
- Temporary deviation with plan to align later

**All exceptions must be documented in ADRs** with justification and remediation plan.
