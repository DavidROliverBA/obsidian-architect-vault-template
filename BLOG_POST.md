## Introduction

As a Solutions Architect, you juggle multiple projects, make critical technical decisions, collaborate with numerous stakeholders, and constantly learn new technologies. Your brain is a knowledge management system under constant pressure.

What if you had a second brain—a personal knowledge base that helps you:
- **Track all your projects** with clear status and priorities
- **Document architectural decisions** with full context and rationale
- **Capture meeting notes** linked to projects and people
- **Manage tasks** across multiple initiatives
- **Build a knowledge graph** of your professional world

Today, I'm excited to share the **Obsidian Architect Vault Template**—a comprehensive, production-ready knowledge management system specifically designed for Solutions Architects.

---

## Why Another Note-Taking Template?

**Because architecture work is unique.**

Generic note-taking systems don't address our specific needs:
- We make decisions that impact systems for years
- We need to track *why* decisions were made, not just *what*
- We collaborate with dozens of stakeholders across projects
- We work with complex technology stacks requiring documentation
- We need to find information fast (that ADR from 6 months ago!)

This template is built from a real, production vault used daily by a Solutions Architect at a major airline. It's been refined through hundreds of projects, thousands of notes, and real-world architectural work.

**It's not just theory—it's battle-tested.**

## What You Get

### 📁 Complete Vault Structure

A metadata-driven organization system that uses **frontmatter fields instead of folders**:

```yaml
type: Project
status: active
priority: high
```

**Why?** Because Dataview queries are more powerful than folders. Change a project's status from `active` to `completed` and it automatically moves to the right views. No manual file moving required.

### 📝 13 Note Types

Every note has a purpose:

**Core Types:**
- **DailyNote** - Your daily journal and task log
- **Meeting** - Capture discussions and decisions
- **Task** - Actionable work items
- **Project** - Major initiatives
- **Person** - Contacts and collaborators

**Architecture Types:**
- **ADR** - Architecture Decision Records
- **Page** - Long-form documentation

**Organization Types:**
- **Organisation** - Vendors and partners
- **Weblink** - Saved resources
- **MOC** - Maps of Content (navigation)

**Plus:** AtomicNote, Course, CodeSnippet

### 🗺️ 12 Maps of Content (MOCs)

Pre-built navigation hubs powered by Dataview queries:

1. **Dashboard** - Your central command center
2. **Tasks MOC** - All tasks by priority/status
3. **Projects MOC** - Portfolio management
4. **People MOC** - Contact directory
5. **Meetings MOC** - Meeting history
6. **ADRs MOC** - Decision tracking
7. **Weblinks MOC** - External resources
8. **Technology & Architecture MOC** - Tech standards
9. **Organisations MOC** - Vendor directory
10. **Vault Quality Dashboard** - Health monitoring
11. **Cloud Architecture MOC** - Example domain MOC
12. **Data Platform MOC** - Example domain MOC

**Each MOC includes:**
- Multiple filtered views
- Statistics and metrics
- Quality checks
- Best practices documentation

### 🤖 Claude Code Integration

Pre-built AI workflows for common tasks:

```
/daily              # Create today's daily note

## The Power of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

One of the most valuable features is the **ADR system**.

### What's an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record documents:
- **Context** - Why did we need to make a decision?
- **Decision** - What did we decide?
- **Rationale** - Why did we choose this option?
- **Consequences** - What are the positive and negative impacts?
- **Alternatives** - What else did we consider?

### Why ADRs Matter

**6 months from now, someone will ask:**
> "Why are we using PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB?"

Without ADRs, the answer is:
> "Uh... I think Bob mentioned something about transactions?"

With ADRs, the answer is:
> "See [[ADR - Standardize on PostgreSQL]]. We evaluated 3 options, prioritized ACID compliance for financial data, and accepted the tradeoff of less flexible schemas."

**ADRs are your architectural memory.**

### ADR Lifecycle in This Vault

```
draft → proposed → accepted → deprecated/superseded
```

Each status has its own view in the ADRs MOC. Track decisions from inception to implementation to eventual replacement.

**Example ADR queries:**
- All accepted decisions (your current standards)
- Proposed decisions needing approval
- Decisions not reviewed in 12+ months (time to validate)
- Decisions by confidence level (track uncertainty)

---

## Metadata-Driven Organization

### Traditional vs This Vault

**Traditional folder structure:**
```
Projects/
  Active/
    Cloud-Migration.md
  Completed/
    Legacy-Decommission.md
  On-Hold/
    Research.md
```

**This vault:**
```
Project - Cloud Migration.md      # status: active
Project - Legacy Decommission.md  # status: completed
Project - Research - Events.md    # status: paused
```

**The difference?**

**Dataview query:**
```dataview
TABLE status, priority, timeline
FROM ""
WHERE type = "Project" AND status = "active"
SORT priority ASC
```

**Result:** Dynamic views that update automatically. Change a project's status and it instantly appears in the right views. No manual file reorganization.

### The Power of Metadata

Every note has rich metadata:

**Projects:**
```yaml
status: active | paused | completed
priority: high | medium | low
category: Digital Transformation | Platform | etc.
timeFrame: 2025-09-01 - 2026-06-30
stakeholders: ["[[Jane Smith]]", "[[Alex Johnson]]"]
```

**ADRs:**
```yaml
status: draft | proposed | accepted | deprecated
category: technology | architecture | security
confidence: low | medium | high
verified: true | false
reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD
relatedTo: [["[[Other ADR]]"]]
supersedes: [["[[Old ADR]]"]]
```

**This metadata powers:**
- Filtered views in MOCs
- Statistics and reporting
- Quality monitoring
- Relationship tracking

## The Knowledge Graph Effect

Here's where it gets powerful.

After a month of using this vault, you have:
- 20 daily notes
- 15 meeting notes
- 10 tasks (5 completed)
- 3 projects documented
- 2 ADRs created
- 5 people added
- Dozens of interconnected links

**Now the magic happens:**

**Open Jane Smith's person note:**
- Auto-generated list of all meetings with Jane
- All tasks assigned to Jane
- Projects Jane is involved in

**Open Project - Cloud Migration:**
- All ADRs related to cloud migration
- All meetings about the project
- All tasks for the project
- Daily notes mentioning the project

**Open ADR - Use Kubernetes:**
- Which projects implement this decision
- Which meetings discussed it
- Who was involved in the decision

**You've built a knowledge graph** where every piece of information connects to relevant context.

**6 months later**, you can instantly find:
- "What did we decide about databases?" → ADRs MOC
- "When did I last talk to Jane about cloud?" → Jane's person note
- "What was blocking Project Alpha in Q3?" → Daily notes from that period

---

## Quality Monitoring Built-In

The **Vault Quality Dashboard** helps you maintain a healthy knowledge base:

**It catches:**
- Notes without required metadata
- Broken wiki-links
- Orphaned content (no backlinks)
- Stale ADRs not reviewed in 12+ months
- Active projects not updated in 30+ days
- Missing summaries on meetings

**Example quality check:**
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
  file.link as "ADR",
  reviewed as "Last Reviewed"
FROM ""
WHERE type = "Adr"
  AND status = "accepted"
  AND reviewed < date(today) - dur(365 days)
SORT reviewed ASC
```

**Result:** List of accepted ADRs that haven't been reviewed in a year. Time to validate they're still correct!

**Run this weekly** and keep your vault clean and valuable.

## Common Questions

### Q: I'm not a Solutions Architect. Can I use this?

**A: Absolutely!**

This works for:
- Enterprise Architects
- Technical Architects
- Platform Engineers
- Engineering Managers
- Senior Engineers
- Technical Program Managers

Anyone who makes technical decisions, manages complexity, and needs to remember context.

### Q: Is this overkill for small projects?

**A: Start simple, grow as needed.**

Week 1: Just daily notes and tasks
Week 2: Add meetings and people
Week 3: Start ADRs
Month 2+: Full system

Use what you need. The structure scales with you.

### Q: Do I need Claude Code?

**A: No, but it helps.**

The vault works perfectly without Claude Code. You'll just:
- Create notes manually from templates (still fast)
- Search using Obsidian search (still powerful)
- Navigate via MOCs (still comprehensive)

Claude Code adds convenience, not requirements.

### Q: What about mobile?

**A: Yes, Obsidian Mobile works great!**

- iOS and Android apps available
- Sync via Obsidian Sync or iCloud/Dropbox
- Full markdown support
- Most plugins work on mobile
- Quick capture on the go

### Q: Can my team use this together?

**A: Yes, with Git collaboration.**

Store vault in Git repository:
- Team members clone repo
- Commit and push changes
- Pull updates from team
- Merge conflicts are rare (markdown is merge-friendly)

Works well for 2-10 people. Larger teams may want separate vaults with shared standards.

### Q: What's the learning curve?

**Obsidian basics:** 1-2 hours
**This vault structure:** 1-2 days
**Mastery and customization:** 2-4 weeks

**But you're productive immediately.** You don't need to master everything to get value.
