## Style Guide

### Markdown

- Use ATX-style headers (`#` not `===`)
- One blank line between sections
- Bullet lists with `-` not `*`
- Code blocks with language: ` ```yaml`
- Links: `[[Wiki Links]]` for internal, `[Text](URL)` for external

### Frontmatter

- Always include `type` field
- Use lowercase for status/priority values
- Date format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- No `#` prefix for tags in frontmatter
- Maintain alphabetical order of fields (where sensible)

### Dataview Queries

- Use `TABLE WITHOUT ID` for cleaner output
- Add comments explaining complex queries
- Sort results meaningfully
- Limit results when appropriate
- Test queries against example notes

### File Naming

- Follow established conventions in README
- Use Title Case for names
- No special characters except `-`
- Be descriptive but concise

### Templates

- Include helpful inline comments
- Provide example values
- Use Templater syntax (`<%*` ... `_%>`)
- Auto-rename files where appropriate
- Mark required vs optional fields

   - Check for query errors

3. **Test Templates**:
