## Understanding the Vault Structure

### Metadata-Driven Organization

This vault uses **metadata (frontmatter) over folders** for organization:

**Traditional folder approach:**
```
Projects/
  Active/
    Cloud Migration.md
  Completed/
    Legacy Decommission.md
```

**This vault's approach:**
```
Project - Cloud Migration.md       (status: active)
Project - Legacy Decommission.md   (status: completed)
```

**Why?** Because:
- Dataview can filter/sort by any field
- No need to move files when status changes
- Multiple dimensions of organization (status, priority, category, etc.)
- Flat structure is easier to navigate and search

### The `type` Field

Every note has a `type` field that determines its purpose:

```yaml
type: Project    # A project you're working on
type: Task       # A to-do item or action
type: Meeting    # Meeting notes
type: Person     # Contact information
type: ADR        # Architecture Decision Record
type: Page       # Long-form documentation
# ... and 7 more types
```

**MOCs use Dataview to query by type:**
```dataview
TABLE status, priority
FROM ""
WHERE type = "Project" AND status = "active"
```

### Special Folders

Folders prefixed with `+` have special purposes:

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `+Daily/` | Daily journal entries (organized by year) |
| `+Meetings/` | All meeting notes |
| `+Attachments/` | Images, PDFs, documents |
| `+Templates/` | Note templates |
| `+Inbox/` | Quick capture landing zone |

**Everything else** lives in the root directory!

## Creating Content

### Creating Notes

**Via Claude Skills** (Fastest):
- `/daily` - Today's daily note
- `/meeting <title>` - Meeting note with prompts
- `/task <title>` - Quick task creation
- `/adr <title>` - Guided ADR creation
- `/person <name>` - New contact
- `/weblink <url>` - Save URL with AI summary

**Via Templates** (More control):
1. Open `+Templates/` folder
2. Copy desired template
3. Paste in root directory (or appropriate folder)
4. Fill in frontmatter
5. Rename file following conventions

### Linking Notes

**Wiki-link syntax:**
```markdown
[[Note Title]]              # Link to note
[[Note Title|Display Text]] # Link with custom text
[[Note Title#Section]]      # Link to specific section
```

**Best practices:**
- Link liberally - more connections = more valuable
- Link people in meetings: `attendees: ["[[Jane Smith]]"]`
- Link projects in tasks: `project: "[[Project - Cloud Migration]]"`
- Link context in daily notes: `Worked on [[Project Name]] today`

### Using Tags

**In frontmatter (NO # prefix):**
```yaml
tags: [project, cloud, infrastructure]
tags: [adr, technology/database]  # Hierarchical tags
```

**In content:**
```markdown
This is a note about #cloud-architecture and #kubernetes
```

**Hierarchical tags:**
```
#domain/infrastructure
#technology/aws/eks
#activity/architecture-review
#project/cloud-migration
```

## Tips for Success

### Start Simple

Don't create everything at once:
1. Week 1: Daily notes + meetings
2. Week 2: Add tasks and people
3. Week 3: Start ADRs for decisions
4. Week 4: Create project notes
5. Month 2+: Refine and customize

### Be Consistent

**Daily habits:**
- Morning: Create daily note, plan day
- During: Capture in real-time
- Evening: Review, reflect, plan tomorrow

**Weekly habits:**
- Weekly review: Tasks, projects, priorities
- Update stale content
- Archive completed work

### Link Everything

**The power is in connections:**
- Daily notes → projects, tasks, people
- Meetings → projects, attendees, decisions
- Tasks → projects, assignees
- ADRs → projects, related ADRs

**More links = more valuable over time!**

### Trust the System

**Don't overthink:**
- Capture first, organize later
- Use +Inbox for quick capture
- Refine during weekly review
- System gets better with use

### Common Questions

**Q: Where do I put X?**
A: Root directory for most notes. Special folders (+Daily, +Meetings, +Attachments) for those types only.

**Q: How do I organize projects/tasks?**
A: Use frontmatter fields (`status`, `priority`) + Dataview queries in MOCs. Don't create folder hierarchies.

**Q: Can I use folders?**
A: Yes, but you'll lose the power of metadata-driven queries. Special folders (+Daily, etc.) are the exception.

**Q: What if I don't use Claude Code?**
A: The vault works fine without it! You'll just create notes manually from templates instead of using skills.

**Q: How do I backup?**
A: Use Git (recommended), Obsidian Sync, or cloud folder sync (Dropbox/iCloud/OneDrive).
