# Review GraphQL ADR

## Description

Review and provide feedback on [[ADR - Adopt GraphQL for API Layer]] before Architecture Board meeting on January 15th. This ADR proposes adopting GraphQL to replace our fragmented REST APIs.

**Context:**
- ADR has been through technical PoC showing positive results
- Development teams have provided initial feedback
- Need architecture leadership sign-off before board presentation
- Decision will impact 4 development teams and API strategy for 2+ years

**Key Areas to Review:**
1. **Technical Approach**: Is the phased migration strategy sound?
2. **Cost Analysis**: Are the cost projections realistic?
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Have we addressed major risks adequately?
4. **Team Impact**: Is the 6-month training timeline sufficient?

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Read full ADR document (estimated 30 minutes)
- [ ] Review PoC results and performance metrics
- [ ] Check alignment with [[Page - Architecture Principles]]
- [ ] Verify cost analysis against budget constraints
- [ ] Assess team readiness and training plan
- [ ] Provide written feedback to [[Alex Johnson]] by Jan 12
- [ ] Attend Architecture Board meeting Jan 15 to discuss

## Notes

**2026-01-07:** Alex mentioned that 2 development teams have concerns about the learning curve. Should specifically address this in review.

**Urgency:** HIGH - Architecture Board meeting is in 8 days. Late feedback will delay decision and impact project timeline.

**Related Tasks:**
- [[Task - Document API standards]] - Will need updating if GraphQL approved
