## Today's Focus

- Review [[ADR - Adopt GraphQL for API Layer]] before Architecture Board meeting
- Continue work on [[Project - Cloud Migration]] - Customer Portal monitoring
- 1:1 with [[Alex Johnson]] to discuss API standards documentation

## Tasks

### Due Today

```dataview
TASK
FROM ""
WHERE type = "Task" AND due = date("2026-01-07") AND !completed
```

### Completed Today

- [x] Review Q4 infrastructure costs - identified $8K/month in savings opportunities
- [x] Updated [[Page - Tech Stack Overview]] with latest technology decisions
- [x] Team standup - discussed GraphQL PoC results

## Notes

### Morning

**09:00 - Infrastructure Cost Review**
Reviewed Q4 AWS costs with finance team. Identified several optimization opportunities:
- Unused RDS instances in staging ($2K/month)
- Over-provisioned EC2 instances ($3K/month)
- S3 storage without lifecycle policies ($3K/month)

Action: Created tasks to address each area. Target $8K/month reduction.

**10:30 - GraphQL ADR Review**
Started reviewing [[ADR - Adopt GraphQL for API Layer]]. Initial impressions:
- PoC results look promising (60% data reduction, faster page loads)
- Concerned about team learning curve - 2 teams expressing concerns
- Cost analysis seems realistic
- Migration strategy is sound (phased approach)

Questions for [[Alex Johnson]]:
- How confident are we in the 6-month training timeline?
- What's the plan if PoC results don't translate to production?
- Have we talked to teams who tried GraphQL and reverted?

Need to finish review by Jan 12 for Architecture Board meeting on Jan 15.

### Afternoon

**13:00 - Cloud Migration Status**
Customer Portal migration completed last week is running smoothly:
- ✅ Performance improved 20% vs on-prem
- ✅ Zero incidents since cutover
- ✅ Cost tracking in line with projections
- ✅ Team confidence building

Next migration: Inventory Service (scheduled Feb 2026)

**14:00 - 1:1 with Alex Johnson**
Discussed [[Task - Document API standards]]. Alex making good progress on REST standards, waiting on GraphQL ADR decision before completing GraphQL section.

Agreed to:
- Include code examples in Python and TypeScript
- Create API review checklist template
- Present at February engineering all-hands

Alex seems a bit stressed about workload. Offered to help with API standards doc if needed.

**15:30 - Team Standup**
- Platform team demoing GraphQL PoC tomorrow
- Security team requesting architecture review for new monitoring tool
- DevOps planning Kubernetes upgrade for next month

### Technical Learning

**Discovered:** AWS has new cost anomaly detection feature in Cost Explorer. Could help catch unexpected spend spikes earlier. Adding to backlog for evaluation.

**Reading:** Martin Fowler's article on [[Weblink - Martin Fowler on Microservices]]. Re-reading after our experience with [[ADR - Microservices vs Monolith Decision]]. His warnings about complexity really resonate now that we've lived through it.

## Reflections

**Wins:**
- Cost review found concrete savings opportunities
- Cloud migration continues to go well
- Good progress on GraphQL ADR review

**Challenges:**
- Balancing depth of GraphQL review with other priorities
- Concerned about team capacity - several people seem stretched

**Tomorrow's Priorities:**
1. Finish GraphQL ADR review (high priority - due Jan 12)
2. Attend GraphQL PoC demo
3. Review security architecture for new monitoring tool
